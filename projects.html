		<div class="subProject">A trebuchet is a type of catapult that uses potential energy stored in a large counterweight to throw
			its payload. They were featured prominently in the video game Age of Empires 2, a favorite of me and my 
			cousin. We decided to take that interest to the real world and build one of our own.

        <h3 id="Clock">Binary Clock</h3>
        <div class="subProject">A binary clock is just like a regular clock, but it displays the time in
			a binary (or in my case a psuedo-binary) format.
        </div>
		<div class="subProject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>LED display</li>
				<li>Simple form</li>
				<li>Correct time</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="subProject"><h4>References</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_clock</li>

			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="subProject"><h4>Design</h4>
			<p>I did some research into other builds that people had done and decided to base my design on this blog that I found: <a href="http://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2010_02_01_archive.html">Ken's blog</a></p>
			<p>The core components are </p>
			<ul>
				<li>ATMega328 chip from an Arduino Uno (I used an old one with a fried pin) for the logic</li>
				<li>DS3234 Real Time Clock breakout from <a href=https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10160>Sparkfun</a> for keeping the time</li>
				<li>3 LED drivers for powering the LEDs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most of the design follows Ken's blog, especially the schematics. However, I made a few customizations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instead of an LED array, I used individual red, blue, and green LEDs for the hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively</li>
				<li>I was building this as a permanent fixture, so I soldered it to a PCB once I had it working on the breadboard and placed it inside a project box from Radio Shack</li>
				<li>I used a basic wall wort AC adapter for powering the Arduino and the LED drivers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To read the clock, you have to be able to convert the numbers from binary into decimal. My clock has a "Binary Coded Decimal" setup. A tutorial on what that means and how to read it is here: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Read-a-Binary-Clock">WikiHow</a></p>

			<p>The DS3234 is a very cool chip. It is accurate enough that, using this design, I never foresee having to reset it. Because I used the breakout board from Sparkfun that includes a backup battery, I can also unplug the clock and not worry about losing the time. Simply plug it back in and it will have the current time on it. The board is a little expensive for such a simple project, but I installed it using a socket so if I ever decide to use it for another project, I can repurpose it.</p>

			<p>One bad thing about this design, however, is that I did not allow the user to have any inputs without taking the entire clock apart. This means that setting/adjusting the time does require popping out the DS3234 and reprogramming it with a separate Arduino.</p>

		<h4>Log</h4>
		<h5>June 2013</h5>
		<p>After having the clock around for a while, I have had some time to reflect on the design. There are a few drawbacks to the way that I built it:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The time must be set manually. This is fine for most of the year, as the DS3234 keeps time extremely accurately. However, whenever daylight savings time changes, I have to pop the box open and change things forward or backward an hour. I'll probably add a button to do this in the future</li>
			<li>The brightness of the LEDs prevents me from keeping this anywhere near the bedroom, as it's too bright to sleep next to. I think this could easily be fixed with a potentiometer that would look nice on the front of the box.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In general, I am very pleased with the outcome. It makes a great clock and piece of art for friends who don't have any interest in learning binary.</p>

		<h5>September 2012</h5>
		<p>I went and picked out a project box to put it in, so I'm ready to start soldering things to the PCB. I'm not going to say that I'm a master solderer or circuit designer, so it's a little bit messy. But hey, it works:</p>

		<p>Drilled a few holes, added a strain relief, and viola: a finished binary clock. It's now happily telling time on my desk at home.</p>

		<h5>August 2012</h5>
		<p>All the electrical parts are in and I have them attached to a breadboard for testing/coding. Here's a picture of the setup (you can see the different components laid out, and the seconds and minutes working):</p>

		<div class="subproject">
			<p>For this project, I embarked on building my own PC for gaming in the living room. I had always been a console person when I was younger, but the idea of being able to tweak my computer to do more interesting things became more of a priority as I got older and could afford it.</p>

			<p>I originally started with just the idea of a gaming computer. As time went on, I gradually developed an interest in a full-featured entertainment system that would interface with the TV and stereo and feature networked media storage and control.</p>
			<p>When I had done a little bit of research, I gradually started buying parts. These were my original specs:</p>

				<li>Rosewill challenger case</li>
				<li>ASRock z7 p67 motherboard</li>
				<li>Intel i5 2500K CPU</li>
				<li>Coolermaster Hyper 212 CPU cooler</li>
				<li>8 GB GSkill RAM</li>
				<li>NVidia GTX 450 GPU</li>
