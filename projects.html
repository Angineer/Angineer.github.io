        <h3 id="Clock">Binary Clock</h3>
        <div class="subProject">A binary clock is just like a regular clock, but it displays the time in
			a binary (or in my case a psuedo-binary) format.
        </div>
		<div class="subProject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>LED display</li>
				<li>Simple form</li>
				<li>Correct time</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="subProject"><h4>References:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_clock">Binary Clock</a></li>

			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="subProject"><h4>Design Log</h4>
			<p>I did some research into other builds that people had done and decided to base my design on this blog that I found: <a href="http://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2010_02_01_archive.html">Ken's blog</a></p>
			<p>The core components are </p>
			<ul>
				<li>ATMega328 chip from an Arduino Uno (I used an old one with a fried pin) for the logic</li>
				<li>DS3234 Real Time Clock breakout from <a href=https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10160>Sparkfun</a> for keeping the time</li>
				<li>3 LED drivers for powering the LEDs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most of the design follows Ken's blog, especially the schematics. However, I made a few customizations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instead of an LED array, I used individual red, blue, and green LEDs for the hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively</li>
				<li>I was building this as a permanent fixture, so I soldered it to a PCB once I had it working on the breadboard and placed it inside a project box from Radio Shack</li>
				<li>I used a basic wall wort AC adapter for powering the Arduino and the LED drivers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To read the clock, you have to be able to convert the numbers from binary into decimal. My clock has a "Binary Coded Decimal" setup. A tutorial on what that means and how to read it is here: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Read-a-Binary-Clock">WikiHow</a></p>

			<p>The DS3234 is a very cool chip. It is accurate enough that, using this design, I never foresee having to reset it. Because I used the breakout board from Sparkfun that includes a backup battery, I can also unplug the clock and not worry about losing the time. Simply plug it back in and it will have the current time on it. The board is a little expensive for such a simple project, but I installed it using a socket so if I ever decide to use it for another project, I can repurpose it.</p>

			<p>One bad thing about this design, however, is that I did not allow the user to have any inputs without taking the entire clock apart. This means that setting/adjusting the time does require popping out the DS3234 and reprogramming it with a separate Arduino.</p>

			<h5>August 2012</h5>
			<p>All the electrical parts are in and I have them attached to a breadboard for testing/coding. Here's a picture of the setup (you can see the different components laid out, and the seconds and minutes working):</p>

			<img src=pictures/Clock_Breadboard.jpg>

			<p>Here is my code: <a href=/resources/Clock_Run.ino>Code</a></p>

			<h5>September 2012</h5>
			<p>I went and picked out a project box to put it in, so I'm ready to start soldering things to the PCB. I'm not going to say that I'm a master solderer or circuit designer, so it's a little bit messy. But hey, it works:</p>

			<img src=pictures/Clock_Guts.jpg>

			<p>Drilled a few holes, added a strain relief, and viola: a finished binary clock. It's now happily telling time on my desk at home.</p>

			<img src=pictures/Clock_Final.jpg>

			<h5>June 2013</h5>
			<p>After having the clock around for a while, I have had some time to reflect on the design. There are a few drawbacks to the way that I built it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The time must be set manually. This is fine for most of the year, as the DS3234 keeps time extremely accurately. However, whenever daylight savings time changes, I have to pop the box open and change things forward or backward an hour. I'll probably add a button to do this in the future</li>
				<li>The brightness of the LEDs prevents me from keeping this anywhere near the bedroom, as it's too bright to sleep next to. I think this could easily be fixed with a potentiometer that would look nice on the front of the box.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In general, I am very pleased with the outcome. It makes a great clock and piece of art for friends who don't have any interest in learning binary.</p>

		<h3 id="HTPC">Home Theater PC</h3>
		<div class="subproject">
			<p>For this project, I embarked on building my own PC for gaming in the living room. I had always been a console person when I was younger, but the idea of being able to tweak my computer to do more interesting things became more of a priority as I got older and could afford it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Be able run high end video games with moderately good graphics</li>
				<li>Fit within a $600-800 budget</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

				<li><a href="http://www.musicpd.org">Music Player Daemon</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Design Log:</h4>
			<p>I originally started with just the idea of a gaming computer. As time went on, I gradually developed an interest in a full-featured entertainment system that would interface with the TV and stereo and feature networked media storage and control.</p>
			<p>When I had done a little bit of research, I gradually started buying parts. These were my original specs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rosewill challenger case</li>
				<li>ASRock z68 extreme3 gen3 motherboard</li>
				<li>Intel i5 2500K CPU</li>
				<li>Coolermaster Hyper 212 CPU cooler</li>
				<li>8 GB GSkill RAM</li>
				<li>NVidia GTX 460 GPU</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I had originally gone low-range on the GPU to save money. Eventually, that decision started to feel like it was holding the computer back from doing some of the fancier things I was looking for, so I upgraded to an EVGA GeForce GTX 760. To be honest, it didn't make too much of a difference, but it feels a little more future-proof to me.</p>
			<p>Once the GPU was upgraded, I felt like the only component that I hadn't maxed out was the hard drive. All the cool kids were going solid state, and prices were dropping, so I grabbed one on Newegg when I found a good deal. Under some circumstances, it makes things blazing fast. Under others, it's not as noticeable.</p>
			<h5>August 14, 2014</h5>
			<p>With the main components of the gaming computer completed, I have started to work on the integration into a larger, interconnected home theater system. Currently, the gaming computer is hooked up to the television, and we can use it for gaming and watching content on the internet. With the current work that Valve is putting into making Steam living room-friendly, it works out quite nicely.</p>
			<p>I'm thinking that I want to set up a server to operate as a NAS so that content can be added/removed from anywhere on the network and then also streamed to any devices in the house. I recently switched my website hosting from a raspberry pi to GitHub pages, so I think I may reclaim the little guy for this project.</p>
			<h5>November 4, 2014</h5>
			<p>I now have the NAS setup on my Raspberry Pi using an external hard drive and a samba share, and it generally works great. In addition, I have a little application running on the Pi that I learned about when I was a member of Solid State Depot, the Boulder hackerspace. It's called <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/">MPD</a>. It allows you to set up a music server that can play music locally or stream it to any other computer on the network, and can be controlled from any computer on the network.</p>
			<p>I'm starting to feel like I want to use my desktop for more things that actually require a desk, so I'm thinking of finding a smaller, less-powerful computer to hook up to the TV. With Steam, I can still stream to the TV for games, but then I'll be able to work on spreadsheets in a more comfortable setting. However, it's going to have to wait until I find a really good deal on another computer.</p>

		<h3 id="Spud">Potato Cannon</h3>
		<div class="subproject">A popular device for launching potatoes into the sky. This project was started around the same time as the <a href="#Treb">trebuchet</a> (do you see a theme?).
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>

				<li>Shoot potatoes</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Design Log:</h4>
			<p>I had seen a number of potato cannons before with slight variations, but we based our design on one in Make Magazine. There were two differences in ours: we didn't use clear plastic and we didn't use a stun gun for the ignition. For the body, we used schedule 40 PVC, but we made the entire thing black.</p>
			<p>For the ignition, Make used a stun gun. However, we didn't have one lying around, so we were having a hard time figuring out how to do it on the cheap. We tried a variety of different electrical sources, but they all seemed to be putting through too much current and actually left residue on the electrodes. Finally, we went to the hardware store and splurged on a gas grill sparker (the manual, push-button kind). It was just the ticket, and ignited the fuel with pretty good consistency.</p>

		<h3 id="Ram">Ram pump</h3>
		<div class="subproject">A ramp pump uses the power of gravity to lift water. I've been fascinated by them since I learned about them, so I decided to build one as a demonstration.
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Pumps water without any external power source</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>References:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.clemson.edu/irrig/equip/ram.htm">Clemson University design</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Design Log:</h4>
			<p>I based my design entirely on the Clemson University site, so I relied on them to do all the calculations beforehand. I built my version out of PVC. The only difference is in the swing check valve. When buying parts, I couldn't find a <i>swing</i> check valve, so I bought a <i>spring</i> check valve and took the spring out. Because it was brass, the weight of the valve kept it open in a vertical position so it could basically act just like the swing valve.</p>
			<h5>October 8, 2014</h5>
			<p>I got the last few pieces from the hardware store, welded and screwed everything together, and have something that looks like the diagram:</p>
			<img src="pictures/Ram.png">
			<p>As a test, I set the ram up on a hill at my parent's farm. The inlet water was being provided by a garden hose, so the water level and pressure were a little hard to control, but I managed to get it running. It's hard to see in these pictures, but the inlet hose is at the top of the ladder and the outlet hose is way up above in the red circle. Here's a video: <a href="http://youtu.be/r8bAmm3fzXM">Test Run</a>.</p>
			<img src="pictures/RamTest1.png">
			<img src="pictures/RamTest2.png">
			<p>After playing with the brass valve and trying to get a rhythm going, I realized that it was too difficult for the water to close the valve (probably because it wasn't an actual swing valve). To solve this, I used a small spring (smaller than the one it came with), which made the distance the valve had to move a little shorter.</p>
			<h5>October 18, 2014</h5>
			<p>Westhampton has an annual Fall Festival and this year my grandparents (who were organizing it) asked me to bring the ram pump to show off. I set the pump up with a big tank on the inlet side, rather than a garden hose, which helped demonstrate the fact that the pump runs entirely on gravitational energy. I did notice that, because the setup was different from at the farm, I had to adjust the brass valve to open more easily. I did this by simply taking out the small spring that I had used and letting it operate entirely by gravity.</p>
			<p>The ram was a pretty big hit and I think that people who had never heard of such a thing before were pretty impressed.</p>

		<div class="subproject"><h4>Design Log:</h4>
			<p>I originally started this as a project with my college friends. In the beginning, we wanted to fund it by redeeming containers on campus (as there was a huge surplus of them). For the most part, we were successful. We bought a set of basic parts, including the chassis, servos, DC motors, battery, and some of the power management and motor driver circuits just from the cash we got redeeming cans and bottles. However, the robot never really got to a functional point while I was in college.</p>
			<p>After I graduated, however, I got the time to design and built more of the steering hardware, and the robot starting driving around: <a href="http://youtu.be/JkxERz-3ysc">The steel box design</a></p>
			<p>The main issue that came up next was the weight of the robot. The chassis we had started with was a gigantic steel box that put some strain on the driving system. In addition, the steering hardware was fairly shoddy.</p>
			<h5>April 24 2013</h5>
			<p>I'm finally getting back into working on this project. The 2 areas I'm focused on right now are getting the steering hardware built and finalizing the circuitry. Here are a couple pics of testing the motor driver circuit and (finally) soldering it to a real circuit board:</p>

		<h3 id="Rocket">Soda Bottle Rockets</h3>
		<div class="subproject">This one was 100% inspired by my high school physics class. In the class, we had to build rockets out of a soda bottle that could carry an egg. At the top of the rocket's flight, the egg was supposed to eject and be carried back to earth with a parachute. I thought it was so much fun that I went home and built my own launch pad.
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Requirements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Launch rockets made of soda bottles</li>
				<li>Allow pressurization using a bicycle pump</li>
			</ul>

				<li><a href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-05/soda-bottle-rocket/">Make Magazine</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subproject"><h4>Design Log:</h4>
			<p>Like a handful of my projects, this one came from Make Magazine. The biggest difference with our design was, instead of having a tall pole with guylines, our launcher was short and attached to a piece of plywood so it would sit directly on the ground with no extra setup. We also used a simple nail in place of the retainer/release spring.</p>
			<p>Once the launch pad was done, we designed some rockets and had a blast (pun intended). The results are available for viewing on my Youtube channel: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB04EEA5E017BD8A1">Rocket TV</a>.</p>
