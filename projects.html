<div>A trebuchet is a type of catapult that uses potential energy stored in a large counterweight to throw
its payload. They were featured prominently in the video game Age of Empires 2, a favorite of mine and my 
cousin's. We decided to take that interest to the real world and build on of our own.</div>
