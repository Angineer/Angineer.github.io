	<p>I grew up in Westhampton, MA, playing with LEGOs, going to school, watching Bill Nye, and exploring the hills and woods around my parents' farm. We always had cats, so I would consider myself a "cat person." I played a lot of Pokemon Red on my Gameboy Color.</p>
	<p>In high school, I ran on the cross country and track teams. When I wasn't running, I was riding my bike, which, at the time, was the most expensive thing I ever bought. I also took to the stage with drama club, played trumpet in band, and organized the movie club with my friend (you can see some of our videos on my Youtube channel). </p>
	<p>In college, I studied mechanical engineering. I decided to become an engineer because I love to build things. I went to school in Troy, NY, which was the first time I had ever lived in a city. After college, my girlfriend and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, where I did a lot of hiking and learned what a hackerspace was.</p>
	<p>Now, I am studying robotics in Pittsburgh, PA. I play the banjo, have a dog, and love to eat waffles.</p>
	<p>Here is my resume: <a href="resources/Andrew Tracy Resume.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></p>
	<p>Don't confuse me with <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/282905/andy-tracy">Andy Tracy</a> of the MLB</p>
