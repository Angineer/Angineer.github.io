<p>The banana leads him to a page on his brother's website.</p>

<p>The title seems to indicate that it's the last part of this wacky treasure hunt.</p>

<p>As Ruth reads the webpage, he thinks of his brother putting this together for him. Although his brother was the one that actually wrote the narration... so is his brother thinking of himself? That's so meta. What is this, an episode of Community?</p>

<p>Anyway, Ruth imagines that his brother is hoping he has a nice birthday and is doing well despite these <i>unprecedented times</i>. Ruth imagines he misses him and is hoping that he is dreaming big dreams of his future as he gets closer to graduating college.</p>

<p>And then, finally, at the bottom of the page, is a gift. Or an explanation, rather. Back when Ruth looked inside the envelope, there was a long number under the QR code. Maybe he assumed it had something to do with that. But actually, it was a gift card code for Powell's City of Books.</p>

<p>All he has to do to redeem the gift card is enter the number here (after making an account): <a href="https://www.powells.com/GiftsGiftCards/ActivateRedeemCards.aspx">Redemption</a></p>

<p>The narrator in his head hopes he likes it.</p>

<p>Love, Andy and Emi</p>
