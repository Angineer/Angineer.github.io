<p>The banana leads her to a page on her brother's website.</p>

<p>The title seems to indicate that it's the last part of this wacky treasure hunt.</p>

<p>As she reads the webpage, she thinks of her brother putting this together for her. Although he was the one that actually wrote the narration... so is he thinking of himself? That's so meta. What is this, an episode of Community?</p>

<p>Anyway, she imagines that he is hoping she has a nice birthday and is doing well despite these <i>unprecedented times</i>. She imagines he misses her and is hoping that she is dreaming big dreams of her future as she gets closer to graduating college.</p>

<p>And then, finally, at the bottom of the page, is a gift. Or an explanation, rather. Back when Ruth looked inside the envelope, there was a long number under the QR code. Maybe she assumed it had something to do with that. But actually, it was a gift card code for Powell's City of Books.</p>

<p>All she has to do to redeem the gift card is enter the number here (after making an account): <a href="https://www.powells.com/GiftsGiftCards/ActivateRedeemCards.aspx">Redemption</a></p>

<p>The narrator in her head hopes she likes it.</p>

<p>Love, Andy and Emi</p>
