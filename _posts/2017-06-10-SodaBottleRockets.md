This one was 100% inspired by my high school physics class. In the class, we had to build rockets out of a soda bottle that could carry an egg. At the top of the rocket\'s flight, the egg was supposed to eject and be carried back to earth with a parachute. I thought it was so much fun that I went home and built my own launch pad.

#### Requirements:

* Launch rockets made of soda bottles
* Allow pressurization using a bicycle pump

#### References:

* [Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/projects/make-05/soda-bottle-rocket/)

#### Design Log
Like a handful of my projects, this one came from Make Magazine. The biggest difference with our design was, instead of having a tall pole with guylines, our launcher was short and attached to a piece of plywood so it would sit directly on the ground with no extra setup. We also used a simple nail in place of the retainer/release spring.

Once the launch pad was done, we designed some rockets and had a blast (pun intended). The results are available for viewing on my Youtube channel: [Rocket TV](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqXg6Sc_zQ4YyfjORbdJicAUr0IDx4Sy6).
