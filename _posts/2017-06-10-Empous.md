I've always been interested in coding as a hobby and learned various languages in my free time. The first programming language I learned was BASIC, and I learned it on the TI-83 calculators that we had in high school. I made a few games, and my friend Ryan also made a very cool game called Empous for the TI-83. It was an empire management game, and I was always impressed with how complex it was, given that it ran on a tiny little calculator screen.

Another language that I have learned is Java. When I finished my first introductory course, I wanted a project on which to practice my new skills. So I decided to make a remake of Empous for the PC.
