        <p>The tunnel enlarged slightly and Octavian found himself in a small room. Gathered all around was a throng of mice, only slightly larger than usual. Upon seeing him, one of the mice turned and exclaimed "Well what's this then?"</p>
        <p>"Hello, my name's Octavian" he replied. "I'm looking for some carrots of mine that went missing."</p>
        <p>"Some sob story that is" another mouse chimed in. "Just like you humans, always going off on some 'quest'. You think you're so self-important. You just look like a big naked badger to me."</p>
        <p>Slightly taken aback, Octavian asked "pardon my boldness, but perhaps you might help me find the one that took them?"</p>
        <p>"Maybe we'll help you" replied another mouse. "But you've got to impress us first. Put on a little show and if we like it, we'll point you in the right direction. Dance for us, monkey!"</p>
