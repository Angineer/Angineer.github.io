        <h1>A Rabbit</h1>
        <p>Around the next bend, Octavian was quite surprised to find a man-sized rabbit lying among a pile of cakes and candies.</p>
        <p>"Aha!" Octavian shouted. "You must be the thief who stole my carrots!"</p>
        <p>"Carrots?" replied the hare. "Blech! I'd never eat such a thing. Once I found out about pastries, I quit vegetables and never looked back. The fellow you're looking for is probably further along."</p>
        <p>Octavian realized that the rabbit's figure seemed to reflect his taste. The creature was quite large around the waist and his rolls of fat jiggled as the hare reached up with a hind leg to scratch behind one of his ears. Perhaps he was telling the truth about the carrots.</p>
        <p>"How about you?" asked the rabbit. "Are you a fan of desserts? Perhaps I could interest you in a strawberry danish?"</p>
