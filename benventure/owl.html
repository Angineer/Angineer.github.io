        <h1>Owl</h1>
        <p>Octavian spotted motion ahead and held his lantern aloft. He was surprised to see a large owl standing in the tunnel, staring him down.</p>
        <p>Octavian was no expert in owls, but he was pretty sure that this one was hungry. And based on its talons and beak, combat with the animal would be no easy task. Slowly, Octavian moved his hand toward the hilt of his sword as he weighed his options.</p>
        <p>As he prepared to jump into action, Octavian noticed something else in the tunnel. Behind the large owl were three tiny owlets, peeping at him with their adorable little eyes. Octavian realized that this beast was merely a mother trying to feed her growing family. This obviously complicated the matter.</p>
        <p>How could Octavian justify slaying the owl simply for trying to take care of its children? Visions of his own family flashed through his mind.</p>
