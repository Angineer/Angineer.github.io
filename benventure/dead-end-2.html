        <h1>Just a Note</h1>
        <p>Octavian looked around, but the only thing he saw was a note on the ground. It read:</p>
        <p><em>To find the thing you seek<br>Three clues you must find<br>Simply view the correct sources<br>And read between the lines</em></p>
        <p><em>The three clues together<br>Will make a simple phrase<br>Just put it in your path<br>And upon the solution you will gaze</em></p>
        <p>Below the words, there were three pictures in this order:</p>
        <p>A sleeping person, a mouse, and a well.</p>
