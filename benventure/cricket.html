        <h1>A Cricket</h1>
        <p>In the next section of tunnel, Octavian came across a little cricket. Upon seeing Octavian, the cricket seemed to perk up a little.</p>
        <p>"Hello" said the insect. "My name is Jim. I seem to have gotten myself a little lost down here and perhaps you could help me."</p>
        <p>"Alright" said Octavian. "I'll give it a shot."</p>
        <p>"I'm confident that I can find my way out eventually" explained Jim. "But the real question is about sustenance. You see, I have a few seeds and some grass trimmings here with me. I'm getting quite hungry, but I don't know how much further I will have to go before I reach the surface."</p>
        <p>"So would it be better for me to wait and stretch my rations longer, or am I safe to consume them now?"</p>
