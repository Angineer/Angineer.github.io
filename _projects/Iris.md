My brother Ruth has spent a lot of time studying media and art in school with a strong focus on comic books. After seeing some of his artwork, I was inspired to design a comic book that we could work on together. I also recruited my good friend Rob, who has a lot of experience reading and analyzing comics.

### Design
The main character in our comic book is a girl named Iris. She grew up in a rural commune, so she lacks an understanding of modern society, but also has some unique experience and perspectives. The story follows her after she leaves the commune and goes off on an adventure of her own.

### Build Log

#### Summer 2019
The ideas for this project have been stewing in the back of my brain for a while. Over the summer, we started to put those ideas down and really refine them, paving the way for the first issue.

We decided to split the work up so that one of us would write the script, one would do the pencils and ink, and one would do the color. We're considering rotating for each issue so that we could all try our hand at the different parts. For issue 1, I will do the script, Ruth will do the sketches, and Rob will do the colors.

Here are concept images that we've created:

{% include img_v.html idx=0 %} {% include img_v.html idx=1 %} {% include img_v.html idx=2 %} {% include img_v.html idx=3 %}

#### Jan 25, 2020
We've made some good progess, although a lot of our time has been spent defining our working process and learning what tools we want to use. Ruth has generally being doing the sketches and ink on paper, then scanning it into the computer. I've convinced everyone that we should use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for the digital parts of the process.

We have 2 pages complete, but they aren't the first two pages. I'm waiting until we have page 1 done to start posting them online.

Also, the work necessary to realize the comic has proven to be more than we originally thought. Ruth has been too busy to focus on the sketching, so we decided to switch up the roles a little. We're going to use what he's produced for the first 4 pages, then I'm going to take over for the rest of issue 1. We'll see how things work out for issue 1, then decide our approach for issue 2.

#### Oct 2, 2023
The last three years have been long. We survived a pandemic. I had a child. Despite all that, I've managed to stick with the comic book and I'm happy to say that all the pages of issue 1 are sketched, inked, and colored.

Now that that work is done, I can look back over the entire issue with a broader and more experienced perspective. In particular, I can take the time to spot mistakes and inconsistencies in what we've produced. I can also try to smooth out issues where my style evolved as I worked. I'm going to make a final pass to clean up those problems, then I will start looking into getting it printed so I can have a few physical copies. I like the idea of trying to sell a few just for fun, so I'll see if the local comic shops will take them.

Because issue 1 has taken a lot longer than I originally hoped, I have a different idea of what I think we should do with issue 2. The time commitment of creating high quality, full color pages got in the way of having fun and collaborating, especially when this was just a hobby project that we worked on in our spare time. I really want to continue telling Iris' story, but I want to make it possible for everyone on the team to be more involved. So I think the best route forward is to change the format of the next issue. It can be something much simpler and faster that allows us to capture the story but doesn't demand so much time and attention. That way it can be more fun. And then we can reevaluate and decide how we enjoy telling this story.
