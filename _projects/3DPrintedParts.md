This is just a collection of interesting things I\'ve made on the 3D printer.

### Camping chair repair
I found this old camping chair in a dumpster and decided to take a shot at saving it and fixing it up. The 3D printed parts actually worked spectacularly; I had a really difficult time getting the fabric fixed using the sewing tools I had available.

### Power of Attorney
I love a good pun, and this was my attempt at extracting a groan from my friends. It's a USB charger enclosure in the form of the word "ATTORNEY."

### Servo mount
A small mount to connect an ultrasonic ranger to a servo for my [robot project](Robot.html), based on models I had seen on Thingiverse. I couldn't find one to download for free, so I made my own.

### Solar enclosure
A small enclosure for a regulator circuit so that you can charge USB devices from a solar panel (or any other source).

### Nerf Gun Cam
This is a mod to a nerf gun of mine to allow it to be fired from a computer. You can see the result on [Youtube](http://youtu.be/vGRJ7N-sHWg).

### Robot steering assembly
This is one of the early designs for the steering on my [robot project](Robot.html).
